                        Our story starts a few years back. Our founder, The Original Hound! Had a casual Doctor's appointment and was strongly advised that if he didn't stop eating greasy Hamburgers and French Fries that he would die prematurely of heart attack.
                        
                        Our founder surely took that advice seriously and started his own Greasy Burger Joint. 
                        His Doctor warned him about this so you know what he did? 
                        He got a new fucking Doctor. Welcome, to Round Hounds!
